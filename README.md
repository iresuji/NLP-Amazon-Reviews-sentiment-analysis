# Sentiment Analysis Model for Amazon Product Reviews

## Overview

This project involves the development and deployment of a sentiment analysis model for Amazon product reviews. The model is designed to predict whether a given review expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment based on the text provided.

## Files Included

1. `sentiment_analysis_model.py`: Python script containing the sentiment analysis model implementation.

2. `preprocess_text.py`: Python script with functions for text preprocessing, used in the sentiment analysis model.

3. `amazon_product_reviews.csv`: Dataset containing Amazon product reviews used for training and testing the model.

4. `requirements.txt`: File listing the dependencies required to run the project.

5. `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project, instructions for usage, and additional information.

## Instructions for Usage

### Installation

1. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

csharp
Copy code

2. Ensure that the spaCy model is downloaded:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

markdown
Copy code

3. Download the dataset (`amazon_product_reviews.csv`) and place it in the project directory.

### Training the Model

No explicit training is required for the sentiment analysis model as it utilizes a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

### Running the Model

Execute the `sentiment_analysis_model.py` script to analyze sentiments in Amazon product reviews. The script reads the dataset, preprocesses the text, and predicts sentiments using the pre-trained model.

### Results and Evaluation

The results of the sentiment analysis are printed, indicating the predicted sentiment for each review. Evaluation metrics can be implemented and analyzed further for model performance assessment.

## Project Structure

- The sentiment analysis model is encapsulated in `sentiment_analysis_model.py`.
- Text preprocessing functions are included in `preprocess_text.py`.
- The dataset is stored in `amazon_product_reviews.csv`.

## Future Improvements

1. Fine-tuning the model on a domain-specific dataset for enhanced performance.
2. Implementing a web-based interface for user-friendly interaction with the sentiment analysis model.
3. Continuous monitoring and updates to improve model accuracy and address limitations.
